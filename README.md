# Project Title : 
Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

## Description

I started this project by importing data and then i started seeing the each and every column and realizing why the columns important, further i went to analysis the dataset, During the time of analysis, I initially did EDA on all the features of our datset. I first analysed our dependent variable 'TenYearCHD', then next i analysed independent categorical variable and after that independent contineous numerical variables, then i have done some preprocessing on data set and handled the missing data, duplicate data and outliers and also see the distribution of data. Then i have done some encoding of categorical variables.
Next i implemented 4 machine learning algorithms Logisctic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Adaboost. I also did hyperparameter tuning to improve our model performance, and then i created the API and used the Postman application to see the result.

## Dataset Information
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham,Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk offuture coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
